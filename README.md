# JS Canvas Pinch Effect

[Pinch/pucker an image in canvas (StackOverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33402497/pinch-pucker-an-image-in-canvas)

An attempt at imitating the pinch effect on canvas.

The desired effect is the one in Gimp or glfx.js. Photoshop one is okay.

After understanding how the effect works, I'll rewrite it and use WebGL. Can't do it now, because I have no knowledge on WebGL.

```javascript
function pinch(canvas, x, y, radius, strength) {
	// code
	return pinchedCanvas;
}
```
