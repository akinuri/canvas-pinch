# JS Canvas Pinch Effect

[Pinch/pucker an image in canvas (StackOverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33402497/pinch-pucker-an-image-in-canvas)

An attempt at imitating the pinch effect on canvas. The desired effect is the one in Gimp or glfx.js. Photoshop one is okay.

Source code for both Gimp and gjfx.js is available, but I have no knowledge about WebGL (glfx.js) or C (Gimp). I'm stuck at the moment.

```javascript
function pinch(canvas, x, y, radius, strength) {
	// code
	return pinchedCanvas;
}
```
