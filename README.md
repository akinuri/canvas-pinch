# JS Canvas Pinch Effect

[Pinch/pucker an image in canvas (StackOverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33402497/pinch-pucker-an-image-in-canvas)

An attempt at imitating the pinch effect on canvas.

Desired effect is the one in Gimp or glfx.js. Photoshop one is okay.

pinch(canvas, x, y, radius, strength);

Any help is appreciated.
